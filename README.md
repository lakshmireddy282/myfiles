#for emotion detection : 
I have used a deepface library of python which gives the analysis of a image of a person which include age , gender , dominat emotion, race.
Deepface is a lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis framework for python. 
The library is mainly based on Keras and TensorFlow.
Using deepface we can also do tasks like facial recognition, facial verification, facial attributes analysis, real time analysis,face detecting.
